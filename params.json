A huge step up from pencils and paper for both the judges, the candidates and the administrative services at Selor.\r\n\r\nRevit is build using open-source components and open development to ensure easy adaptability in the future. The application was designed, built, evaluated and deployed during an intensive 4 week program at [open Summer of code](http://summerofcode.be), an initiative that allows students to work on real world applications for companies and governmental institutes.\r\n\r\n## Main benefits\r\nThe main benefits are clear from the start. We go over the 3 biggest ones.\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width: 33%; background: red;\" markdown=\"1\">\r\n# test 1 2\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is oSoc\r\n## Screenshots\r\n## Partners\r\n## Who we are\r\n_Who you guys are (link to LinkedIns &/or twitter)_\r\n\r\n## Contact info\r\n\r\n## Extra Sauce!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Attributions\r\n\r\nIcons by:\r\n* [Irene Hoffman](https://thenounproject.com/i)\r\n\r\n",
