  "body": "# Project description\r\n\r\nFor [Selor](http://www.selor.be/) an agency that provides recruiting services for over 150 different governmental institutes, we build an application to ease the scoring of candidates in face-2-face interviews.\r\n\r\nWith Revit, the judges at Selor are able to quote any job candidate from any device, whether it's a tablet, a smartphone or a laptop. A huge step up from pencils and paper for both the judges, the candidates and the administrative services at Selor.\r\n\r\nRevit is build using open-source components and open development to ensure easy adaptability in the future. The application was designed, built, evaluated and deployed during an intensive 4 week program at [open Summer of code](http://summerofcode.be), an initiative that allows students to work on real world applications for companies and governmental institutes.\r\n\r\n## Main benefits\r\nThe main benefits are clear from the start. We go over the 3 biggest ones.\r\n\r\n### Fast\r\nNo more needless input of candidate data.\r\nNo more time spent on copying the quotes to an electronic system.\r\n\r\n### Secure\r\nBetter overview of inconsistencies and anomalies.\r\nNo more missing or blank results.\r\n\r\n### Adaptable\r\nLast minute changes to a test become a breeze to change with the built in edit features.\r\n\r\n## What is open Summer of code\r\nOpen Summer of code -oSoc in short- is a 4 week programme in different Belgian cities during the summer of 2016. The goal: provide Belgian based students the training, network and support necessary to transform open innovation projects into powerful real-world services.\r\n\r\nFind out more about oSoc here: [2016.summerofcode.be](http://2016.summerofcode.be/)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n**[TBD]**\r\n\r\n## Who we are\r\n_Who you guys are (link to LinkedIns &/or twitter)_\r\n**[TBD]**\r\n\r\n## Contact info\r\n\r\nYou can talk to us via linkedIn, or send an email to: **[TBD]**\r\n\r\n\r\n## Attributions\r\n\r\nIcons by:\r\n* [Irene Hoffman](https://thenounproject.com/i)\r\n\r\n",
